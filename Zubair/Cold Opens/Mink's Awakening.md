Why is the world rocking and has a fleeting thought that he should have asked Khajit for advice
Slowly comes to his senses before opening his eyes and realizes he is curled up on a comfy bed, so it can't be all bad

Sunlight. Just beginning to filter in through the shutters
Rosjens bare ass, and is that another halfling there as well? Somewhat distracted by...what Mink can only describe as rosjens befeathering.
