Our tale begins in the [[Wayward Channel]], four days outside of [[Empyrean]]. Our intrepid, and unlikely, heroes awake to the sound of an announcement bell outside their heads and a different sort of bell inside their heads from the previous night's festivities. [[Mink]] tactfully convinced [[Rosjen]] to stay in bed and sleep off his hangover and made his way above deck. [[Shepard]] is already above deck but looks even worse than [[Rosjen]]. Perhaps next time he'll lay off the [[Honey Mead]]. [[Brontus]], stoic as ever, sits by himself toward the bow, while our good friend [[Sandy]] waits silently to hear the announcement.

Then, as all of these things start, the precipitous event happens. Out of [[Captain Klax]]'s cabin strides [[Doc]] and [[Gnorr]], with no [[Captain Klax]] in their wake. Instead, [[Doc]] announces that over night, the captain has died. [[Brittany Four-Fingers]] stoops to corroborate his lies. The crew panics but appears aimless. [[Mink]] notices [[Shepard]] attempting to sneak into [[Captain Klax]]'s cabin and suddenly the ghost of [[Captain Klax]] appears. [[Shepard]] tries to sneak in unnoticed and nearly falls to his death. He calls upon the [[Luminaires]] and gets [[The Seer]]. [[Sandy]] disappears below deck to try and find some food for [[Lucky]]. [[Rosjen]] finally wakes up and comes up top to see what's going on. [[Brontus]] tries to investigate the ghost before it slips below deck, just out of his grasp. Back on deck, trouble is brewing. [[Rosjen]] is getting [[Rodrick]] and crew riled up while [[Shepard]] investigates the captain's cabin. While all this is going on, a storm is brewing, and a large wave begins racing toward [[Captain Klax's Ship]]. [[Mink]] tries in vain to get the crew back together to handle the wave, but instead we capsize.
