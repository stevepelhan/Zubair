The scene opens with [[Chef Sous]] center stage at the fire tending the stew. [[Gnorr]] is stage left, desolately kicking at the sand and wreckage strewn across the beach.  [[Sandy]] and [[Mink]] enter stage left.

Sandy: "Gnorr, what are you doing."

Gnorr: "Woe is me. [[Captain Klax]] hath forsaken me."

Mink: "I don't think he forsook you specifically Gnorr."

Sandy picks up a map and a journal from the wreckage. He overly exaggerates his sneakiness but clearly shows the items to the audience. He places them in his pack and winks at the audience.

[[Rosjen]] enters stage right.

[[Rosjen]]: "Hey guys, I found a path." End scene.

We open on [[The New Guys]] gathered around a small, clear, and deep pool of water at stage right. The pool is being fed by tears that fall from the eyes of a shrine to [[The Newborn]]. Stage left is a large tree with a small field of flowers surrounding it.

[[Brontus]]: "Does anyone know what this sculpture is?"

Mink: "Ah, a [[Newborn Shrine]]. Many people revere the newborn. They come to these shrines to bless new beginnings and potentials. Some folk believe that the tears of [[The Newborn]] can lead to eternal life."

[[Rosjen]]: "Then lets go swimming!"

[[Rosjen]] and [[Shepard]] drink from the pool and try to catch some fish for [[Chef Sous]]. Sandy wanders off toward the tree with [[Brontus]] in tow. Mink moves to center stage and watches both groups.

[[Brontus]]: "Have you ever seen a tree like this before? Or these flowers?"

[[Sandy]]: "No. Never."

As they approach two things happen at once. First, a dark nook in the tree roots is illuminated and a hidden door can be seen. Second, the flowers release a cloud of noxious gas that poisons and injures [[Sandy]].

They pass through the cloud and magic flashes as they cure themselves. [[Brontus]] with the grace of god, and [[Sandy]]...with sand? I don't know whatever. Both of them try to open the door with no success. [[Mink]] steps up and breathes fire all over the flowers in an attempt to neutralize their poison, to no avail. 

[[Brontus]] calls out to Lucky: "Do you know anything about this?"

[[Lucky]]: "The door will open when the time is right." End Scene

Scene opens with [[The New Guys]] stage left in a forest. As they walk in place, the background trees move past. After a few seconds, a jail wagon enters stage right with 2 Harengon and 1 Tabaxi inside. Outside the cage, is a cockatrice chained to the wagon.

[[The New Guys]] battle the cockatrice and free the captured people, including [[Jon-So]]. Immediately after freeing them, goblins begin shooting at the group from the woods. Rather than continue the assault, [[The New Guys]] bravely retreat. [[Mink]] finds a card on a dead goblin that says the people of [[Niwon]] are destroying the natural order and files the information away for later use.

[[Sandy]] returns to the [[Newborn Shrine]] to inform [[Gnorr]] and [[Chef Sous]] of what we found and where the village is. The rest of the group escorts the released prisoners home. On the way, we fight some wolves.
