Once more our heroes awake groggy and sore. You may be starting to see a theme here no? This time, instead of it being the result of their celebrations, we have a rogue wave, and [[Doc]]'s murdering ways, to blame. [[Captain Klax's Ship]] lies just off the coast, in remarkably good condition except for it being in two pieces. [[Chef Sous]] appears to have survived and is beginning to cook a meal for the survivors who lay scattered across the beach. [[Sandy]] lies near [[Stowaway]], [[Mink]] somehow is enveloped in [[Gnorr]]'s arms, [[Shepard]] looks just as he did yesterday, [[Rosjen]] looks wet, and [[Brontus]] looks like he always does, which is to say, awful. 

The group gathers around [[Chef Sous]]'s cook fire to plan their next moves. Will they attempt to fix the ship? Explore the path they found in the woods? Start a new life on this unnamed island? What other surprises will be in store for them? Will [[Chef Sous]] become a famous adventurer? What secrets hide behind [[Stowaway]]'s innocent eyes? Will [[Mink]] and [[Rosjen]] ever find out the truth behind [[Night Water]]'s illicit activities?
