[[Mink]] works on [[Chapter 7.5 - The Story So Far]].

We approach the [[Gates of Rosaki]] and the [[Octavius]] enters on the heels of the [[The Gilded Gryphon]]. We quickly dock in the locks and are greated by [[Captain Frommen]] and his men. We learn the local custom of the three blinks and that the captain is only there due to an attempted assassination attempt on the king.

[[Fancy Hilda]] pays our docking fee but we owe her two favors. She also pays what is clearly a customary fee and not at all a bribe to [[Captain Frommen]].

[[Fancy Hilda]] takes [[The Gilded Gryphon]] to the [[Gallery of Guilds]] and asks us to meet her there when we're ready. [[Mink|Captain Mink]] takes [[Octavius]] to the far side of [[The Docks]] and where we're met by [[Dudo Diggle]]. He showed us the entrance to [[Rosaki Sewers|The Sewers]].

Met [[William Wheatflower]], the dwarven fish seller.

Moved on to the [[Derty Dogg]] and Mink had a bard off.

Heard a commotion where our poor friend [[William Wheatflower]]'s fish cart was horrendously attacked and set out to set the matter straight.
