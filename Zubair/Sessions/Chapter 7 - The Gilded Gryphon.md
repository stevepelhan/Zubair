[[Azilon Rebellion]]
[[Mink's Awakening]]

Curtains open in [[Fancy Hilda]]'s cabin aboard [[The Gilded Gryphon]]. It's an idyllic setting. The cabin is well appointed and sun can be seen streaming in through the boarded up window. On the small bed we can see [[Rosjen]], face down, nude, [[Fancy Hilda]] under the covers, and [[Mink]], curled up like a Pseudodragon. He slowly opens his eyes, takes stock of the scene, does a double take when he notices [[Rosjen]] and [[Fancy Hilda|Hilda]], covers [[Rosjen]], and leaves. As he gets up to leave, the backdrop rotates.

Now we see the exterior of the boat. On the deck is [[Gerard Oilring]] and several crates and barrels. The lid of one barrel slowly rises to the sound of a slide whistle as [[Shepard]] briefly emerges, looks around, and slinks back into the barrel, accompanied by more slide whistle. [[Mink]] emerges from the cabin door into the scene. He looks around briefly and strolls up to the barrel and knocks. [[Shepard]]'s head slowly rises again.

[[Mink]]: Howdy [[Shepard|Shep]]. Sleep well?

[[Shepard|Shep]] gives a bear yawn.

[[Mink]]: Me too [[Shepard|Shep]], me too 

[[Gerard Oilring]] approaches the two.

[[Gerard Oilring]]: Howdy fellas. You look like you could use some of my special rehydration potion.

[[Mink]]: Ooooooo. I've heard of these [[Shepard|Shep]]. 

[[Shepard]]: What's it do?

[[Gerard Oilring]]: Well, if you drink it, it will rehydrate you.

[[Shepard]]:...so, it's water?

[[Gerard Oilring]]: Well, I mean, it's hydrating!

[[Fancy Hilda]] emerges from the cabin, and [[Rosjen]] scuttles into view shortly after.

[[Fancy Hilda]]: Well, any last minute todos? No? Then we're off.

Curtains close and rise again. This time we're still on the boat, inside a cavern, with another boat nearby.

[[Fancy Hilda]]: Alright boys. Just have to conduct this totally legitimate business transaction in this totally not a smuggler's hideout and then we can keep on heading to the city.

The goblin captain comes aboard and absconds with [[Fancy Hilda]] in her cabin. A gnome on the other ship begins rapping while cargo is exchanged. [[Mink]] joins in along with [[Snagk]].

Before leaving, [[Shepard|Shep]] spots a new boat trying to sneak up on the port. [[Fancy Hilda]] helps us identify it as a ship belonging to [[The Squids]], some competing business associates known for their underhanded business dealings. [[The New Guys]] and [[Fancy Hilda]]'s firstmate, [[Hiroshi the Blade]], decided to have a word with them about their tactics and would you know it, they attacked us. We defended ourselves and, through totally legitimate salvage rights, found ourselves in possession of a new boat which we christened [[Octavius]].

[[Mink]] declared himself captain and conjured up an illusionary pirate's hat and we set off following [[The Gilded Gryphon]] to [[Rosaki]].
