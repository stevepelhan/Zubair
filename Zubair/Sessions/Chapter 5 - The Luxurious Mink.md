Curtains open on [[Mink]] and [[Jon-So]] center stage. Behind them is a scene of [[Niwon]]. There is a bon fire to the left, a small stage in the background with musicians, and a nice house to the right. Many revelers are scattered in the background. As the two talk in the foreground, we see [[Shepard]] and [[Rosjen]] slink from stage right to behind the backdrop painting.

Mink: Alright Jon-So, you remember the plan? We need to get the celebrations rolling so that everyone thinks we have the [[Angel Bone]] already. We'll have to put on a good show to make it believable. Can you do that?

Jon-So: I...I think so Mr. Mink. I'll do my best.

Mink: Of course you will. Here we go.

Mink summons flashes of color and smoke and loud party favor type noises. A neon sign reading "The Luxurious Mink" flickers to life behind him as the stage slowly rotates on it's axis. Once the background has rotated, we see [[Shepard|Shep]] and [[Rosjen]]. There is a lovely garden with a water feature on one side, and a well manicured Zen garden next too it. In the distance we see the back of the magistrates house and just on the far side of the background is a Shoji door. An eerie noise plays in the background, coming from the garden.

[[Rosjen]]: Do you hear that?

[[Shepard|Shep]]: Hear what?

[[Rosjen]]: Nevermind, let's just get to the house and get this [[Angel Bone]].

[[Shepard]] and [[Rosjen]] sneak through the garden to the door. [[Rosjen]] is purposeful and deliberate. [[Shepard]] is exaggerated. Making silly somersaults and skips and jumps with 180 degree turns. When the get to the door [[Rosjen]] Jims the audience.

[[Rosjen]]: What was that?

[[Shepard|Shep]]: Whatcha mean? I'm a master at the art of stealth. Watch and you could learn a thing or two gramps.

[[Shepard|Shep]] flashes a claw, and slowly cuts through a panel on the Shoji door.

[[Shepard|Shep]]: Coast is clear.

[[Rosjen]]: Merciful [[The Starwatcher|Starwatcher]].
The backdrop rotates again.

Scene 3: [[Mink]], [[Jon-So]], and [[Khajit No-Coin]].

[[Mink]], [[Jon-So]], and [[Khajit No-Coin]] are near the fire. The music and revelry are in full swing. 

[[Khajit No-Coin]]: [[Jon-So]]. I need the [[Angel Bone]] [[Jon-So]]. I couldn't possibly do my very simple job without it. How would I know where to put the chairs?

[[Jon-So]]: Well, thing is, we'll get you the angel bone first thing in the morning. Why don't you just enjoy yourself tonight and relax.

[[Khajit No-Coin]]: You're not paying me to relax. That'll be extra.

[[Jon-So]]: Well I'll be. Suppose it will be then.

Backdrop rotates again. This time, we see [[Rosjen]] and [[Shepard|Shep]] inside a small room. [[Rosjen]] walk calmly through the background. [[Shepard|Shep]] again runs comically from wall to wall, exaggeratedly peaking around corners and using hand gestures. [[Rosjen]] just shakes his head. They come to the fireplace.

[[Shepard|Shep]]: Where is it, it's supposed to be above the fire place.

[[Rosjen]]: How would I know. It's obviously not there. Let's keep looking.

[[Shepard|Shep]] looks all around the house, continue his antics.

[[Shepard|Shep]]: It's not here.

[[Rosjen]]: Let's check upstairs.

As we start to rotate, [[Shepard|Shep]] and [[Rosjen]] head over the the stairs. [[Shepard|Shep]] trips going up the stairs. We're outside, in front of the house this time. [[Mink]] and [[Jon-So]] are with [[Larry Evans]].

[[Larry Evans]] (Clearly sus): So, ah, you managed to find another [[Angel Bone]] [[Jon-So]]?

[[Jon-So]]: Ya-hup. Thanks to these here adventurers. Mr. [[Mink]] saved my life, my daughters love, and my as of yet unborn great grandchildren's lives.

[[Mink]]: You flatter me good sir. We couldn't have done it without you. Nor without you [[Larry Evans]]. Your refusal to give [[Jon-So]] the angel bone sparks this whole affair....Why did you refuse him the angel bone in the first place?

[[Larry Evans]]: Well, ah, you see, ah, it's because, um, ah, what's that?!
He points behind us, and as we look, he runs away.

[[Mink]]: Suspicious.

The back drop rotates again revealing [[Rosjen]] and [[Shepard|Shep]] upstairs in a above average creepiness attic. There are several chests, a mannequin wearing a wedding dress, and some other odds and ends. The eerie wailing can be heard faintly in the background.

[[Rosjen]]: I don't see it anywhere.

[[Shepard|Shep]]: But I do spy a lovely dress. Yoink.

The wailing grows louder as [[Shepard]] removes the dress from the mannequin.

[[Rosjen]]: Let's check out these boxes.

They both move to the boxes to investigate. As [[Shepard|Shep]] approaches the final box, it transforms into a mimic and tries to bite him. He Scobby Do runs in mid air back down the stairs with [[Rosjen]] in his wake as the backdrop rotates. As it rotates, they simply move around the side and join [[Mink]] at the party scene.

[[Mink]]: Ah, the intrepid Robin Hoods. Tell me you have the bone.

[[Rosjen]]: It wasn't there dude.

[[Mink]]: What do you mean it wasn't there. [[Jon-So]] said it would be right over the fireplace.

[[Shepard|Shep]]: Well it wasn't! We looked everywhere and all we found was this cool wedding dress.

[[Mink]]: Hmm, it seems we'll have to take matters into our own hands.

As they speak, [[Larry Evans]] enters stage right, near his house, with his guard, [[Evans Larry]].

[[Mink]]: Ah, the man of the hour. [[Larry Evans]]. My friends here were just arriving. They were asking about your [[Angel Bone]].

[[Shepard|Shep]]: We've had one [[Angel Bone]] yes. But how about a second?

[[Larry Evans]]: Ah, um....what?

[[Mink]]: What my esteem colleague was asking, is, can we please see your [[Angel Bone]]. We'd love to compare it to the one we helped [[Jon-So]] find.

As this happens, the crowd quiets and looks around.

[[Larry Evans]]: Um...no?

The crowd: [[Angel Bone]]! [[Angel Bone]]!

[[Larry Evans]]: Ahhhhh, gosh darn it. You got me. I don't have the [[Angel Bone]]. After I buried my wife it up and disappeared.

The Crowd gasps. Someone shrieks. The background rotates and the crowd and crew walks around with it. Now we're at the graveyard where [[Shepard|Shep]] and [[Rosjen]] encountered the baby. [[Jon-So]] hangs back.

[[Larry Evans]]: Well, we all buried her. I used the angel bone in the ritual as we do. Then, I put back on top of the fireplace, and when I woke up, it was gone.

[[Mink]], to [[Jon-So]]: [[Jon-So]], why won't you come to the graveyard?

[[Jon-So]]: Well, I never could bring myself to say goodbye to his wife, my childhood love.

[[Granddaughter]]: Come on granddaddy. It's time.

[[Jon-So]]: Goodbye my love.

The wailing stops. The angel bone appears on top of the grave. The crowd gasps, and the curtain drops.
