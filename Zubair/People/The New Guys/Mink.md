## Intro
How does one describe Mink? How can you distill all that he is into words?  Where would you start?

You might mention that Mink looks like a warm hug from a friend you haven't seen in a long time.

Perhaps you notice his beautiful cape billowing in a non existent wind? It's a deep, velvety, forest green with a stylized version of the forgotten hearth embroidered in delicate white thread. Perhaps you've seen that symbol before no?

Or maybe you notice that he looks an awful lot like a dragon. Smaller, sure. Bipedal, yes that too.
