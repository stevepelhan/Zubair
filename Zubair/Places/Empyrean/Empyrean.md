## Description
The anarcho-capitalist sin city positioned at the mouth of [[Rowmore Run]] as it flows into [[Talare Bay]]. Virtually all rivers from [[Zubair]] flow to [[Verdemar]], where they merge into [[Rowmore Run]] which create the river delta upon which [[Empyrean]] was built.

The town grew haphazardly and a survival of the fittest form of architecture formed. Those who buttressed their land with boulders wouldn't get washed away with floods. Silty islands washed away with time.
