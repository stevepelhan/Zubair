Here the land is mostly sand. The sun is hot and there isn\u2019t quite enough refuge. But shade is critical. You don\u2019t want to be trapped in the sun when it\u2019s high above. The night is the time to escape and make your moves. Now the sand. The sand isn\u2019t any normal sand. This sand makes glass. Glass forged at the mountain of Desolis by the [[fire elves]] themselves. This is the land of Azilon.</p> <p>Azilon is occupied by many beings, believe it or not. [[Dark elves]] and [[orcs]] primarily, a few golemish creatures here and there, and perhaps most interestingly a new race. A race that is orc/elf hybrid. They call themselves the [[Unditi]]. Let\u2019s start with the [[dark elves]]. After all they think of themselves as most important. The [[dark elves]] can be broken into a number houses. The [[Yazlor]] are the religious type, the [[Khram Chasu]] keep something; like time; the [[Dykuma]] collect all that sand, and the [[Durganda]] are the farmers. The [[orcs]] are slaves. They are the ones who harvest the sand. They gather it and carry it. Day and night! And you don\u2019t want to be out during the day. The golems are built by the houses. They all serve different purposes. Some houses make them to be house keepers, while others can be found in the trenches. Helping the orcs to gather the sand.</p> <p>[[Unditi]] are new and they have it pretty bad. [[Dark elves]] have their traditions and the [[Unditi]] buck those. But some [[Unditi]] aren\u2019t exactly accepting the status quo. [[Jaafan]] is the leader of these rebels and wants a change. To get this change [[Jaafan]] has been liberating different camps and towns. Is he making friends, building an army, or something else?</p> <p>Well, I certainly don\u2019t know. But I do know he is responsible for me being here now. It was a normal evening like any other I\u2019ve had. I was out in the sand with the orcs. We had been working the entire day. Dusk was coming on, when the orcs and myself began to see lights grow from the camp. Myself and the twins began our way back to camp. Perhaps curiosity or concern drew us there. What we found was something we couldn\u2019t quite believe. The elves were suppressed, captured or dead and the camp on fire. The orcs were frantic but unscathed. And we found fighters that were orc and elf looking. Myself and my friends gave ourselves up quickly. Eventually we met the leader of the\u00a0 uprising, it was [[Jaafan]] himself. [[Jaafan]] had no quarrel with us. He offered a spot in his ranks to us, seemingly trying to grow his numbers. I could not accept myself, but [[the twins]] were eager to join. He offered me a chance at freedom. I accepted. Thus I travelled with the horde. Until ultimately we came to the border of Azilon\u2026 and here I am now. There seems to be a change in Azilon. And only time will tell how this plays out.</p>"},{"location":"Cold%20Opens/Mink%27s%20Awakening/","title":"Mink's Awakening","text":"<p>Why is the world rocking and has a fleeting thought that he should have asked Khajit for advice Slowly comes to his senses before opening his eyes and realizes he is curled up on a comfy bed, so it can't be all bad Slowly opens eyes and begins to take in the scene Gently rocking boat Sounds of the waves lapping against the...wood?

Our intrepid, and unlikely, heroes awake to the sound of an announcement bell outside their heads and a different sort of bell inside their heads from the previous night's festivities. Mink tactfully convinced Rosjen to stay in bed and sleep off his hangover and made his way above deck. Shepard is already above deck but looks even worse than Rosjen. Perhaps next time he'll lay off the Honey Mead. Brontus, stoic as ever, sits by himself toward the bow, while our good friend Sandy waits silently to hear the announcement.</p> <p>Then, as all of these things start, the precipitous event happens. Out of Captain Klax's cabin strides Doc and Gnorr, with no Captain Klax in their wake. Instead, Doc announces that over night, the captain has died. Brittany Four-Fingers stoops to corroborate his lies. The crew panics but appears aimless. Mink notices Shepard attempting to sneak into Captain Klax's cabin and suddenly the ghost of Captain Klax appears. Shepard tries to sneak in unnoticed and nearly falls to his death. He calls upon the Luminaires and gets The Seer. Sandy disappears below deck to try and find some food for Lucky. Rosjen finally wakes up and comes up top to see what's going on. Brontus tries to investigate the ghost before it slips below deck, just out of his grasp. Back on deck, trouble is brewing. Rosjen is getting Rodrick and crew riled up while Shepard investigates the captain's cabin. While all this is going on, a storm is brewing, and a large wave begins racing toward Captain Klax's Ship. Mink tries in vain to get the crew back together to handle the wave, but instead we capsize.</p>"},{"location":"Sessions/Chapter%202/","title":"Chapter 2","text":"<p>Once more our heroes awake groggy and sore. You may be starting to see a theme here no? This time, instead of it being the result of their celebrations, we have a rogue wave, and Doc's murdering ways, to blame. Captain Klax's Ship lies just off the coast, in remarkably good condition except for it being in two pieces. Chef Sous appears to have survived and is beginning to cook a meal for the survivors who lay scattered across the beach. Sandy lies near Lucky, Mink somehow is enveloped in Gnorr's arms, Shepard looks just as he did yesterday, Rosjen looks wet, and Brontus looks like he always does, which is to say, awful. </p> <p>The group gathers around Chef Sous's cook fire to plan their next moves. Will they attempt to fix the ship? Explore the path they found in the woods? Start a new life on this unnamed island? What other surprises will be in store for them? Will Chef Sous become a famous adventurer? What secrets hide behind Lucky's innocent eyes? Will Mink and Rosjen ever find out the truth behind Night Water's illicit activities?</p>"},{"location":"Sessions/Chapter%203/","title":"Chapter 3","text":"<p>The scene opens with Chef Sous center stage at the fire tending the stew.

The pool is being fed by tears that fall from the eyes of a shrine to The Newborn. Stage left is a large tree with a small field of flowers surrounding it.</p> <p>Brontus: \"Does anyone know what this sculpture is?\"</p> <p>Mink: \"Ah, a Newborn Shrine. Many people revere the newborn. They come to these shrines to bless new beginnings and potentials. Some folk believe that the tears of The Newborn can lead to eternal life.\"</p> <p>Rosjen: \"Then lets go swimming!\"</p> <p>Rosjen and Shepard drink from the pool and try to catch some fish for Chef Sous.

Or these flowers?\"</p> <p>Sandy: \"No. Never.\"</p> <p>As they approach two things happen at once. First, a dark nook in the tree roots is illuminated and a hidden door can be seen.

Immediately after freeing them, goblins begin shooting at the group from the woods. Rather than continue the assault, The New Guys bravely retreat. Mink finds a card on a dead goblin that says the people of Niwon are destroying the natural order and files the information away for later use.</p> <p>Sandy returns to the Newborn Shrine to inform Gnorr and Chef Sous of what we found and where the village is.

As the two talk in the foreground, we see Shepard and Rosjen slink from stage right to behind the backdrop painting.</p> <p>Mink: Alright Jon-So, you remember the plan? We need to get the celebrations rolling so that everyone thinks we have the Angel Bone already. We'll have to put on a good show to make it believable. Can you do that?</p> <p>Jon-So: I...I think so Mr. Mink. I'll do my best.</p> <p>Mink: Of course you will. Here we go.</p> <p>Mink summons flashes of color and smoke and loud party favor type noises. A neon sign reading \"The Luxurious Mink\" flickers to life behind him as the stage slowly rotates on it's axis. Once the background has rotated, we see Shep and Rosjen. There is a lovely garden with a water feature on one side, and a well manicured Zen garden next too it. In the distance we see the back of the magistrates house and just on the far side of the background is a Shoji door. An eerie noise plays in the background, coming from the garden.</p> <p>Rosjen: Do you hear that?</p> <p>Shep: Hear what?</p> <p>Rosjen: Nevermind, let's just get to the house and get this Angel Bone.</p> <p>Shepard and Rosjen sneak through the garden to the door. Rosjen is purposeful and deliberate. Shepard is exaggerated. Making silly somersaults and skips and jumps with 180 degree turns. When the get to the door Rosjen Jims the audience.</p> <p>Rosjen: What was that?</p> <p>Shep: Whatcha mean? I'm a master at the art of stealth. Watch and you could learn a thing or two gramps.</p> <p>Shep flashes a claw, and slowly cuts through a panel on the Shoji door.</p> <p>Shep: Coast is clear.</p> <p>Rosjen: Merciful Starwatcher. The backdrop rotates again.</p> <p>Scene 3: Mink, Jon-So, and Khajit No-Coin.</p> <p>Mink, Jon-So, and Khajit No-Coin are near the fire. The music and revelry are in full swing. </p> <p>Khajit No-Coin: Jon-So. I need the Angel Bone Jon-So. I couldn't possibly do my very simple job without it. How would I know where to put the chairs?</p> <p>Jon-So: Well, thing is, we'll get you the angel bone first thing in the morning. Why don't you just enjoy yourself tonight and relax.</p> <p>Khajit No-Coin: You're not paying me to relax. That'll be extra.</p> <p>Jon-So: Well I'll be. Suppose it will be then.</p> <p>Backdrop rotates again. This time, we see Rosjen and Shep inside a small room. Rosjen walk calmly through the background. Shep again runs comically from wall to wall, exaggeratedly peaking around corners and using hand gestures. Rosjen just shakes his head. They come to the fireplace.</p> <p>Shep: Where is it, it's supposed to be above the fire place.</p> <p>Rosjen: How would I know. It's obviously not there. Let's keep looking.</p> <p>Shep looks all around the house, continue his antics.</p> <p>Shep: It's not here.</p> <p>Rosjen: Let's check upstairs.</p> <p>As we start to rotate, Shep and Rosjen head over the the stairs. Shep trips going up the stairs. We're outside, in front of the house this time. Mink and Jon-So are with Larry Evans.</p> <p>Larry Evans (Clearly sus): So, ah, you managed to find another Angel Bone Jon-So?</p> <p>Jon-So: Ya-hup. Thanks to these here adventurers. Mr. Mink saved my life, my daughters love, and my as of yet unborn great grandchildren's lives.</p> <p>Mink: You flatter me good sir. We couldn't have done it without you. Nor without you Larry Evans. Your refusal to give Jon-So the angel bone sparks this whole affair....Why did you refuse him the angel bone in the first place?</p> <p>Larry Evans: Well, ah, you see, ah, it's because, um, ah, what's that?! He points behind us, and as we look, he runs away.</p> <p>Mink: Suspicious.</p> <p>The back drop rotates again revealing Rosjen and Shep upstairs in a above average creepiness attic. There are several chests, a mannequin wearing a wedding dress, and some other odds and ends. The eerie wailing can be heard faintly in the background.</p> <p>Rosjen: I don't see it anywhere.</p> <p>Shep: But I do spy a lovely dress. Yoink.</p> <p>The wailing grows louder as Shepard removes the dress from the mannequin.</p> <p>Rosjen: Let's check out these boxes.</p> <p>They both move to the boxes to investigate. As Shep approaches the final box, it transforms into a mimic and tries to bite him. He Scobby Do runs in mid air back down the stairs with Rosjen in his wake as the backdrop rotates. As it rotates, they simply move around the side and join Mink at the party scene.</p> <p>Mink: Ah, the intrepid Robin Hoods. Tell me you have the bone.</p> <p>Rosjen: It wasn't there dude.</p> <p>Mink: What do you mean it wasn't there. Jon-So said it would be right over the fireplace.</p> <p>Shep: Well it wasn't! We looked everywhere and all we found was this cool wedding dress.</p> <p>Mink: Hmm, it seems we'll have to take matters into our own hands.</p> <p>As they speak, Larry Evans enters stage right, near his house, with his guard, Evans Larry.</p> <p>Mink: Ah, the man of the hour. Larry Evans. My friends here were just arriving. They were asking about your Angel Bone.</p> <p>Shep: We've had one Angel Bone yes. But how about a second?</p> <p>Larry Evans: Ah, um....what?</p> <p>Mink: What my esteem colleague was asking, is, can we please see your Angel Bone. We'd love to compare it to the one we helped Jon-So find.</p> <p>As this happens, the crowd quiets and looks around.</p> <p>Larry Evans: Um...no?</p> <p>The crowd: Angel Bone! Angel Bone!</p> <p>Larry Evans: Ahhhhh, gosh darn it. You got me. I don't have the Angel Bone. After I buried my wife it up and disappeared.</p> <p>The Crowd gasps. Someone shrieks. The background rotates and the crowd and crew walks around with it. Now we're at the graveyard where Shep and Rosjen encountered the baby. Jon-So hangs back.</p> <p>Larry Evans: Well, we all buried her. I used the angel bone in the ritual as we do. Then, I put back on top of the fireplace, and when I woke up, it was gone.</p> <p>Mink, to Jon-So: Jon-So, why won't you come to the graveyard?</p> <p>Jon-So: Well, I never could bring myself to say goodbye to his wife, my childhood love.</p> <p>Granddaughter: Come on granddaddy. It's time.</p> <p>Jon-So: Goodbye my love.</p> <p>The wailing stops. The angel bone appears on top of the grave.

The lid of one barrel slowly rises to the sound of a slide whistle as Shepard briefly emerges, looks around, and slinks back into the barrel, accompanied by more slide whistle.
